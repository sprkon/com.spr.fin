# Frontend (PDF Editor UI)

This folder will contain a React + TypeScript app using PDF.js for preview and a mapping editor.

Local dev (suggested):

```bash
cd frontend
npm install
npm run dev
```

Key components to implement in feature slices:
- Document upload and preview (`PDF.js`)
- Mapping editor (original -> replacement)
- Diff/preview UI
- Authentication flow
